<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Matt!</h1>

I've found a surprising amount of overlap between my work as a teacher and my development as a data scientist, and I feel lucky to have grown in both directions.

Teaching has given me years of experience breaking down complex problems, looking at them from multiple angles, and turning them into stories that make sense to others. Data science has added a new set of tools to that same core purpose—finding patterns, drawing insight, and turning those insights into steps people can actually act on. In both fields, the work only matters if the solution is communicated clearly and people can get behind it.
