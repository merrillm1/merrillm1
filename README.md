<h1 align="left">Hi üëã, I'm Matt! I used to be a teacher, now I'm a Data Scientist!</h1>

I've found incredible overlap between my career as a teacher and my journey as a data scientist and I have been lucky to benefit from both to be where I am today. My teaching career gave me a wealth of approaches to understanding problems and disecting possible solutions, all for the aim of making it accessible for others by way of a compelling story. My work as a data scientist has given me tools for solving problems that enhance human capabilities for finding patterns and drawing insight.

In this repository you'll find work I've completed through the career track program I recently graduated from as well as a few more recent projects. A good way of selecting which may be of interest is by visiting my [website](https://merrillm1.github.io/), where you can select projects by key word. I am currently working on a kaggle competition for predicting answer correctness to help rethink traditional ways of learning with AI. Look out for updates on that!
